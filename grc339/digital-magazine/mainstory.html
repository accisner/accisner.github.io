                                                            <li>Season and garnish: Season the zucchini with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. If desired, sprinkle with freshly chopped parsley for added flavor and color.</li>
                                                            <li>Serve: Transfer the seared zucchini with garlic, lemon, crushed red pepper, and mint leaves to a serving platter, and drizzle any remaining lemony-garlic juices from the pan on top.</li>
                                                            <li>Enjoy: Serve this delightful zucchini dish as a side or pair it with your favorite protein for a complete meal.

                        <h3>Bonus Recipe: Pan-Perfect Pizza</h3>
                        <p>

                            To create the Pan-Perfect Pizza, start by preheating your oven to 475¬∞F (245¬∞C). Meanwhile, generously oil a cast iron pan and place it in the oven to heat. In a bowl, combine your favorite pizza dough with a touch of olive oil and let it rest. Once the pan is hot, carefully press the dough into it, creating a thin, even crust. Spread a layer of rich tomato sauce, sprinkle shredded mozzarella, and add your desired toppings‚Äîthink pepperoni, mushrooms, or olives. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly. Finish with fresh basil or a drizzle of olive oil. Allow it to cool slightly before slicing and savoring your homemade, pan-perfect pizza!                        </p>
